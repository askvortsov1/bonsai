# URI Parsing

See the Bonsai Guide [chapter on urls](../bonsai/docs/guide/10-url-routing.mdx).
This library contains the "typed" parsing/unparsing module for URL Var. The
reason that this library exists as a separate library is that URL Var has a
JavaScript browser dependency which makes it unable to run outside of a JavaScript
browser context.

Splitting off the parsing/unparsing logic allows it to be used on native OCaml.
